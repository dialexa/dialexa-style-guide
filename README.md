# Dialexa Style Guide

CSS/ SASS Style base for Dialexa projects


## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - `gem install sass`

"dialexa-style-guide": "https://github.com/dialexa/dialexa-style-guide.git"
```


## Importing into your project

From here, there are a few ways to import the styles...

- 1. A built and prefixed CSS file is included in the project, at `dist/dialexa-style-guide.css`.
- 2. Add the path for `app.scss` to your build pipeline, to build/ concat/ prefix as you see fit.
